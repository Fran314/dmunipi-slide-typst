# `dmunipi-slide` theme for Typst

Typst theme for Mathematics Department of the University of Pisa.

This is a Typst-remake of the Beamer theme [dmunipi-slide](https://github.com/Cirdans-Home/dmunipi-slide)

## How to use

A full guide on how to use this template is given in the [guide](./guide.pdf) (it might also be useful to look at the [source code of the guide](./guide.typ) to understand how some tricks were used).

If you're new to Typst, I would suggest to look at the official [Typst tutorial](https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/) and use the official documentation for any doubt on how to use certain functions.

For an advanced usage, I would also suggest to look at the [Touying tutorial and documentation](https://touying-typ.github.io/docs/intro). Touying is the typst package used to create this theme.
